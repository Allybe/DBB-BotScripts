# Discord Bot Builder Template

## How to use

### Build Or Download
To Build, you first need to make sure that you have all the dependencies installed. Make sure you have Node.js install then run ``npm install``. You can compile the Typescript into Javascript using ``tsc``.

### Put it together like legos  
Once you have the code compiled into Javascript you can put the bot together by just adding the commands you want into a ``commands`` folder. This folder can also be put into sub-folders for categorization of commands.

It's about the same for listeners, just add the Javascript file into a ``listeners`` folder.
